# HystrixDemoApplication

This is a demo application showcasing the usage of Hystrix for circuit breaking in Spring Boot projects.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HystrixDemoApplication.git
    ```

2. Import the project into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

3. Run the main class `HystrixDemoApplication` to start the application.

## About

This project demonstrates how to implement circuit breaking in Spring Boot applications using Hystrix. Circuit breakers are a design pattern used to detect failures and encapsulate the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring during maintenance, temporary external system failure, or unexpected system difficulties.

## Usage

1. Start the application.
2. Access the provided endpoints to see Hystrix in action.

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available:

- `/`: Home endpoint
- `/fallback`: Fallback endpoint

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Hystrix
